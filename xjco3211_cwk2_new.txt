1. Assignment guidance This exercise aims to give you some practical
experience of using serverless architectures. It will also give you the
opportunity to research on the cloud computing domain of Function as
a Service (FaaS), technologies and performance.
Serverless computing is revolutionising cloud application development
as it oﬀers the ability to create modular, highly-scalable, fault-tolerant
applications, with minimal operational management. In order to con-
tribute to its widespread adoption of serverless platforms, the perfor-
mance of functions, including workﬂows, running on such platforms is
key. This coursework therefore aims to investigate the performance of
workﬂow functions.
You should carefully review the lecture notes on serverless architectures
before you start work.
2. Assessment tasks
(a) For the investigation, use Microsoft Azure Functions serverless
platform.
(b) Research into serverless workﬂows deployed on serverless plat-
forms to provide insight into their capabilities and increase aware-
ness of their potential;
(c) Formulate and design a serverless workﬂow of your choice. The
workﬂow should consist of two functions. You are free to imple-
ment more than two functions if your solution requires it.
(d) Specify a cloud-based technical implementation for analysis of
your serverless workﬂow, using one language runtime of your choice.
You can choose, for example, among Python, Java and Node.js.;
(e) Demonstrate the performance of the workﬂow in terms of runtime
and resource consumption, e.g. CPU and memory utilisation.
Requirements
(a) Choose an application of a serverless workﬂow, e.g. image pro-
cessing pipeline, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) etc.
(b) An important aspect of the implementation of the serverless func-
tions is how they are triggered , see lecture slides and examples on
3
the Azure portal. One useful mechanism is the Azure SQL trigger
for Functions, see documentation. You may use the Azure SQL
database as part of the implementation;
(c) For the evaluation, investigate the aspect of scalability by increas-
ing the number of function invocations;
(d) You need to demonstrate your ability to write code to implement
your own serverless functions.
(e) Report your performance results.
Example: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework collects environ-
mental data, e.g. temperature, CO2 level etc from N sensors, which
are simulated using code running in a ﬁrst Azure Function to achieve
high scalability whilst simplifying deployment. This code mimics the
data that would be collected at regular intervals from sensors before it
is stored in a database. Once the new collected data is stored in the
database by the ﬁrst function (simulated data), this will automatically
trigger the second function thanks to a dabase change tracking mech-
anism. The role of the second function is to display various statistcis,
e.g. output the minimum, maximum and average of the data. The
aspect of performance relates to the number of sensors N as well as the
volume of data generated and processed over time.
3. General guidance and study support Learning resources and use-
ful links are available in COMP3211 area on Minerva. Help is also
available on the module Teams channel.
4. Assessment criteria and marking process
The coursework will be marked out of 50. Coursework feedback and
return of marks will be available on Gradescope.
5. Presentation and referencing
The quality of written English will be assessed in this work. As a
minimum, you must ensure:
 Paragraphs are used
 There are links between and within paragraphs although these
may be ineﬀective at times
4
 There are (at least) attempts at referencing
 Word choice and grammar do not seriously undermine the mean-
ing and comprehensibility of the argument
 Word choice and grammar are generally appropriate to an aca-
demic text
6. Submission requirements
 Questions: address the questions in relation to the implemen-
tation, discussion of results, and evidence of execution on Grade-
scope.
 Code: submit your code for the exercise. You can either: 1)
provide a link to Git, or 2) create a Zip or tar archive of the ﬁles
which make up your system and upload it on Gradescope. If you
have organised your ﬁles into a directory hierarchy, then please
package this as a single Zip or tar archive.
 Demonstration: produce a short video (maximum 2 minutes
long) to demonstrate your results. You can either: 1) upload it
on Gradescope, or 2) upload on any cloud platform of your choice,
e.g. Youtube and provide the link.
7. Academic misconduct and plagiarism
Academic integrity means engaging in good academic practice. This
involves essential academic skills, such as keeping track of where you
ﬁnd ideas and information and referencing these accurately in your
work. By submitting this assignment you are conﬁrming that the work
is a true expression of your own work and ideas and that you have given
credit to others where their work has contributed to yours.
